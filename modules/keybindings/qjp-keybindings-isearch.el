  "Kill the region between the mark and the closest portion of
  the isearch match string. The behaviour is meant to be analogous
  to zap-to-char; let's call it zap-to-isearch. The deleted region
  does not include the isearch word. This is meant to be bound only
  in isearch mode.

  The point of this function is that oftentimes you want to delete
  some portion of text, one end of which happens to be an active
  isearch word. The observation to make is that if you use isearch
  a lot to move the cursor around (as you should, it is much more
  efficient than using the arrows), it happens a lot that you could
  just delete the active region between the mark and the point, not
  include the isearch word."
