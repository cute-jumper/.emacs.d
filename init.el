;;; Code:

;; ----------------------------------------------------------------------- ;;
;; First Part: Load all settings under `startup' to finish initialization. ;;
;; ----------------------------------------------------------------------- ;;

;; Define the very root and the startup code directory
(defvar qjp-base-dir (file-name-directory load-file-name)
  "The base directory for configuration files.")
(defvar qjp-startup-dir (expand-file-name "startup" qjp-base-dir)
  "The directory to store elisp scripts that runs at the very beginning.")

;; Add `startup' to load path
(add-to-list 'load-path qjp-startup-dir)

;; Filter function
(defun qjp-filter (condp lst)
    "Filter function from http://emacswiki.org/emacs/ElispCookbook#toc46"
    (delq nil
          (mapcar (lambda (x) (and (funcall condp x) x)) lst)))

;; Function to get feature list
(defun qjp-get-feature-list (dir)
  "List file names under dir after removing .el suffix"
  (qjp-filter
   (lambda (dir) (not (or (string= "." x) (string= ".." x) (string-match "#" x))))
   (mapcar (lambda (x) (substring x 0 (string-match "\\.el" x))) (directory-files dir))))

;; Require all the features in startup
(mapc 'require (mapcar 'intern (qjp-get-feature-list qjp-startup-dir)))

;; -------------------------------------------------------------- ;;
;; Second Part: Load selected settings to complete configuration. ;;
;; -------------------------------------------------------------- ;;

;; Add `modules' and `site-lisp' to `loat-path'
(add-to-list 'load-path qjp-modules-dir)
(qjp-add-subdirectories-to-load-path qjp-site-lisp-dir)
;; Note: Now we are done with the load path

;; Requrire module features as you want

(require 'qjp-functions)                ;useful functions
(require 'qjp-keybindings)              ;key bindings
